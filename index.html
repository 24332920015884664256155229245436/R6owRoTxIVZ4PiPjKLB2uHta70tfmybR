Life's a miracle.
We are not aware of how improbable it is that we are here.
Not only the fact that we were born, but also the fact that we survive every day.
Life's truly a miracle.

But... what can we do when that miracle is simply the result of whimsical and excessive bad luck?
What can we do when that miracle is a curse?

Why waste energy and make superhuman effects when I don't even enjoy the very life I'm fighting for?

Life's a miracle.
Being able to decide whether or not you want to live it, is a right.

I have freed myself from this miracle, and you have freed yourselves from me.

Now everyone can be happy.
